This was a school project where we had to create a front-end website for a ficticious client using html, css, JavaScript, and PHP.
Client requirements were provided from which students constructed their websites such as responsiveness, size limitations, load times,
security, content, and various other requirements. I was only 1 point away from a perfect score. :)</p>
