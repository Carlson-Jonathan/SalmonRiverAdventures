                                Bio: Grandmaster Olympian swimmer Michael Phelps is one of the few qualified individuals to safely guide you through the Devil’s Mouth. With 68 rescues under his belt, he is ever ready and alert of the dangers you will traverse in one of the world’s most perilous (and fun) river adventures. It is rumored that Phelps swam the Devil’s Mouth backwards, including swimming up both 30ft waterfalls, in under 1.5 hours. With him as your guide, you have nothing to fear- unless he calls in sick.<br><br>
